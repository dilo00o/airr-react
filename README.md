# airr-react

This library is set of several React components that allows building mobile apps using React, HTML5 and Cordova.
Airr-react defines few basic features that every UI of mobile app has. It can be your starting point for creating unique apps.

It can be used for:
* creating custom looking and behaving mobile apps,
* rapidly designing prototypes showing you ideas,
* creating common web apps.

To quickly check all it's main features go and see demonstration app:
[airr-react demo app](http://react.airr.pl)

## Prerequisites
Before you continue with project installation make sure you have installed:
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)


## Instalation
### The simplest
The most easy way to start using airr-react components is to add to your allready created (create-react-app) project with npm
```
npm install airr-react
```

### The demo
If you want to explore demo app as a code refference just download `demo-app` directory content and paste it to your project constructed with create-react-app command.
To minimize issues remove `src` and `public` directories of new create-react-app project before copying demo-app content.

### Other
If you are having custom react configuration feel free to investigate airr-react usage on your own. Just install it with npm like in "The simplest" section.


## Usage
For components usage please reffer at the moment to the demo app code. There you will clearly see how specific components are used. I'm planning to write proper documentation in the future.
